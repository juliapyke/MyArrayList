I have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment.
Julia Pyke

Last value: 134210000
--add memory--
Last value: 18030000
Values are being printed *very* slowly in the last bit of the added memory tests.
2nd run last value: 18060000

The second time I ran testMemory() with added memory, the last value was higher than that in the first run. The second time, it seemed to stop at 18020000, but then suddenly went all the way to 18060000 and stopped.

I think this is happening because the added memory makes the compiling/running slower. (Don't really know??)
